# Task 
#### 1. Using restcountries.eu create a text data file in JSON format, containing only the following data about countries in the European Union: name, capital, currencies, population, area.
  - To get this information use this link - http://localhost:8080/countries/get-all

#### 2. Read and process this file with your java program to get the following results:

 - top 10 countries with the biggest population - http://localhost:8080/countries/import-biggest-population
 - top 10 countries with the biggest area - http://localhost:8080/countries/import-biggest-area
 - top 10 countries with the biggest population density - http://localhost:8080/countries/import-biggest-density

#### 3. Add the ability to consume the data about countries directly from the restcountries.eu and process it (keep the code that processes data from the text file as well!)

 - top 10 countries with the biggest population - http://localhost:8080/countries/get-biggest-population
 - top 10 countries with the biggest area - http://localhost:8080/countries/get-biggest-area
 - top 10 countries with the biggest population density - http://localhost:8080/countries/get-biggest-density

#### 4. Convert your application to Spring Boot application and expose results via REST API.

#### 5. Add unit tests
